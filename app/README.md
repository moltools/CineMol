# SAFE Template

This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/). It was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 6.0 or higher
* [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Starting the application

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The build project in root directory contains a couple of different build targets. You can specify them after `--` (target name is case-insensitive).

## Build project for deployment

Run the following command to build the application in release mode:

```bash
dotnet run --project Build.fsproj Bundle
```

You can then find the bundled app in the `deploy` folder.
